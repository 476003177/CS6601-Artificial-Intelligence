    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic image processing is a key component to many AI systems, including facial recognition and video compression, instance segmentation of images and point cloud data. One basic method for processing is segmentation, by which we divide an image into a fixed number of components in order to simplify its representation. For example, we can train a mixture of Gaussians to represent an image, and segment it according to the simplified representation as shown in the images below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/k6_bird_color_24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we could perform a clustering of point cloud in order to separate different objects, backgrounds etc, as shown in the image below\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/pcd_clustered.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn to perform image compression and point cloud segmentation. To this end, you will implement Gaussian mixture models and iteratively improve their performance. First you will perform segmentation on the \"Bird\" (`bird_color_24.png`) and at the end run your algorithm on 3D point cloud data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, you will implement several methods of image segmentation, with increasing complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement k-means clustering to segment a color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Familiarize yourself with the algorithm by running it on simple dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build a Gaussian mixture model to be trained with expectation-maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experiment with varying the details of the Gaussian mixture model’s implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implement and test a new metric called the Bayesian information criterion, which guarantees a more robust image segmentation.\n",

    "## Part 0: Note on Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Vectorization was introduced in the last section of Assignment 4. For this assignment, please vectorize your code wherever possible using numpy arrays, instead of running for-loops over the images being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example of how this might be useful, consider the following array:\n",
    "A = [12 34 1234 764 ...(has a million values)... 91, 78]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to calculate another array B, which has the same dimensions as A above. Say each value in B is calculated as follows:\n",
    "(each value in B) = square_root_of(some constants pi log(k) * (each value in A))/7\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wish to use a for-loop to compute this. However, it will take really long to run on an array of this magnitude.\n",
    "Alternatively, you may choose to use numpy and perform this calculation in a single line. You can pass A as a numpy array and the entire calculation will be done in a line, resulting in B being populated with the corresponding values that come out of this formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out **Basic Operation** section of the Numpy Tutorial if you are not familiar with numpy vector/matrix operations: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html#basic-operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please note that numpy.vectorize DOES NOT perform vectorization, it only does a loop. \n"

    "## Part 1: K-means Clustering (19 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy method for image segmentation is to simply cluster all similar data points together and then replace their values with the mean value. Thus, we'll warm up using k-means clustering. This will also provide a baseline to compare with your segmentation. Please note that clustering will come in handy later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill out `get_initial_means()`, `k_means_step()` functions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `get_initial_means()`, you should choose  k random points from the data (without replacement) to use as initial cluster means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code will be unit tested automatically when you run the cell (`Cell > Run Cells OR Shift + Enter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Try to vectorize the code for it to run faster. Without vectorization it takes 25-30 minutes for the code to run.\n"

    "\n",
    "Next, we will step beyond clustering and implement a complete Gaussian mixture model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before you dive into the code, you are highly encouraged to go over `read/gaussians.pdf` file before you start, to familiarize yourself with multivariate case of the Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to that, there is a great ~17 minute video where Alexander Ihler goes over nuts and bolds of the multivariate EM algorithm details on Youtube:\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMTuMa86NzU\n",
    "\n",
    "Another resource you can refer to is the `read/em.pdf` document attached, which is a chapter from Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Christopher M. Bishop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- - - \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to complete the implementation of the functions below what will later assemble into a Multivariate Gaussian Expectation Maximization algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the probability of a given data point (e.g. rgb value of a pixel) of belonging to a specific Gaussian component. (7 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use expectation-maximization (EM) to train the model to represent the image as a mixture of Gaussians. (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize EM, set each component's mean to the means value of randomly chosen pixels (same as for K-means) and calculate covariances based on the selected means, and set the mixing coefficients to a uniform distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've set the convergence condition for you in `default_convergence()` (see `helper_functions.py` file): if the new likelihood is within 10% of the previous likelihood for 10 consecutive iterations, the model has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** there are packages that can run EM automagically, but you have to implement your own version of EM without using these extra packages. **It also means that you are not allowed to look into any implementations of the algorithms, e.g scikit-learn and many others. NumPy is your only tool here.** \n",
    "\n",

    "To run EM in our baseline Gaussian mixture model, we use random initialization to determine the initial values for our component means. We can do better than this!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in `improved_initialization()` by training a GMM to find initial means. This type of initialization differs from simply increasing training time because we \"reset\" the covariance and mixing coefficient parameters. That is, for training, we recompute covariance parameters based on the means we learned during initialization and again set the mixing coefficients to a uniform distribution. A GMM tends to converge to elongated covariances, so by resetting these parameters we have a higher chance of avoiding local maxima.\n",
